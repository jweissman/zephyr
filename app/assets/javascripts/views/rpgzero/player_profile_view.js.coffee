# TODO little mini-profile view of player
#      just a little picture of their class and their name for now
# TODO view rename -- i'm tempted to have all this live in an 'rpgzero' namespace
#      (which uses a zephyr.js library which wraps around the frontend...
#      similarly, the outcome on the backend should be a simple zephyr DSL
#      for creating a world, simulating actor behavior, and exposing these
#      over websocket/http streaming API)
